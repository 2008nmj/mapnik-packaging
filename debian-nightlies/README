Scripts to build Debian nightlies of mapnik branches, and upload to PPAs.

They currently run on Koordinates' CI server every night at 0000UTC and upload 
to the Mapnik nightly build PPAs at https://launchpad.net/~mapnik

If you want to use the packages created from these scripts add this PPA:

https://launchpad.net/~mapnik/


Requirements:

* apt-get install debhelper devscripts python-scons dput git-core python


Setting up:

1. clone the mapnik git repo from http://github.com/mapnik/mapnik into a git/ dir
2. update the nightly-build.sh script with your name/GPG key/etc, and what 
   branches/dists/ppas you want. Set the latest releases correctly too.
3. set prev.rev in each branch directory to be the current revision of the branch
4. run ./nightly-builds.sh -f -d to make sure it works
5. run ./nightly-builds.sh -c to delete what you just built
6. run ./nightly-builds.sh -f to force the first build & upload
7. after that, run ./nightly-builds.sh and it'll regenerate and upload source 
   packages if something's changed.
8. run ./nightly-builds.sh -c to cleanup occasionally
9. to re-run a single trunk build because you've fixed debian/ stuff, do
   ./nightly-builds.sh -f -b trunk -r 2


Notes:

debian/ directories are taken from the appropriate directory for each branch, 
except for the changelog which is built dynamically.
