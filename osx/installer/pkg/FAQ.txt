Frequently Ask Questions
------------------------

1) Do I need this installer for TileMill?

No, you do not. TileMill bundles its own version of Mapnik inside the .app.

2) What is the purpose of this installer?

Two goals:

 - To support using Mapnik easily from python programs like http://tilestache.org
 - To support easily compiling external c++ applications like node-mapnik 
   (https://github.com/mapnik/node-mapnik) without extra installations.
