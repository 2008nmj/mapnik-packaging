This package will install Mapnik into /usr/local/.

To enable the python bindings you need to put the Mapnik python bindings on your path.

For example, if you are using Python 2.7 you would do:

    export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/$PYTHONPATH

These are the files the installer places:

  - libmapnik in /usr/local/lib
  
  - mapnik datasource plugins and fonts at:
  
    /usr/local/lib/mapnik/
  
  - mapnik and cairo python bindings in:
   
    /usr/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/
    /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/
    /usr/local/lib/python3.3/site-packages/

  - mapnik data needed for proj4, gdal, and unicode support:

    /usr/local/share/mapnik

  - mapnik-config and other programs in /usr/local/bin
