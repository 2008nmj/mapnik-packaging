This package will install Mapnik into /usr/local/.

To enable the python bindings you need to manually put them on your PYTHONPATH like:

    py_version=$(python -c "import sys;print('%s.%s' % (sys.version_info[0],sys.version_info[1]))")
    export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python${py_version}/site-packages/:$PYTHONPATH

These are the files the installer places:

  - libmapnik in /usr/local/lib
  
  - mapnik datasource plugins and fonts at:
  
    /usr/local/lib/mapnik/
  
  - mapnik and cairo python bindings in:
   
    /usr/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/
    /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/
    /usr/local/lib/python3.3/site-packages/

  - mapnik data needed for proj4, gdal, and unicode support:

    /usr/local/share/mapnik

  - mapnik-config and other programs in /usr/local/bin
